# Team Allocation System
A system that facilitates the splitting of students into teams for group projects keeping in mind their preferences (of who they do and do not want on their teams) while maintaining a pre decided ratio in gender and domicile across teams. The system allows lecturers to customise their requirements for teams and along with input from students automatically generates the required teams. After the teams are generated, lecturers can then customise the teams as to their liking.
